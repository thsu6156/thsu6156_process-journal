                <p>In the first week, our team confirmed the topics we are going to investigate. The theme we chose was 'Drone in Medical Field'. We thinks this topic is very important because it is <font color="#CC9933"><b>closely related to our life</b></font>. Meanwhile, it has the <font color="#CC9933"><b>potential to change existing limitations</b></font>. Therefore, we think this is worth considering.</p>

              	<p>After choosing our topic, each of us choose to conduct an investigate in one medical field, and I chose to do 'emergency service'. Before actually doing research about the current emergency service, I looked at different types of the existing medical drone. There is various type of medical drones, for example: HiRO telemedical drone, defibrillator drone, etc. However, most of them are only used when extreme cases occur, or medicine delivered to rural/remote area. There are many drones are still in the trial stage and have not yet been put into use. So far, there are no medical drones for the general public. I think this can be a solution that can help and improve the speed of people's medical treatment. It has great potential and room for development.</p>
                <p>During the investigation, I learned some of the problems that medical field now encounters. First, people living in remote rural areas or areas will have greater life safety issues. About one-third of the Australian people now live in these areas. The biggest problem they face is that the medicines and services they have access to are limited and not good. At the same time, the local lack of large hospitals. This means that if something urgent happens, it takes a long time to get to the hospital in the city. This also greatly reduces the patient's rescue time. In addition, the hospital receives many non-emergency calls every day. For those who really need help, these calls take up the time they are rescued.
                <p>After completing the background research, I did a survey and interview. Some of the key insights I have found are: only 48% of people know how to call an ambulance, there are many problems cause the ambulance to arrive late, many people feel the hospital is inefficient and waste a lot of time, etc. These help me to understand the problems that the hospitals and patients have encountered. After that, I draw the storyboard and the journey map separately according to the problems the hospital or the patient encountered.

                <p>After completing the report, I shared my surveys and reports with the group members. We discussed and studied each other's findings, and finally decided the direction of our theme. We made a timetable, and reasonably assigned each other's tasks. After that, our group came up with five concepts <font color="#CC9933"><b>to help and make medical service more accessible to people</b></font>. The five concepts are: medicine delivery, physical examination van, in-hospital medication delivery, emergency supply drone and mobile infusion stand. The following figure depicts how each idea works:

                <ol>
                 <li>&nbsp;<b>Medical Delivery</b> - customers are able to order the medicine online and drone will then ship the medicine to the designated location in a timely manner.</li>
                 <li>&nbsp;<b>Physical Examination Van</b> - users can book a van for a medical examination instead of going to the hospital. This saves travel time and waiting time in the hospital.</li>
                 <li>&nbsp;<b>In-hospital Medication Delivery</b> - a small automatic car that is mainly responsible for transporting drugs or injections. This may increase efficiency and save time for doctors/ nurses to take things.</li>
                 <li>&nbsp;<b>Emergency Supply Drone</b> - a drone that transports medical equipment. It can reach the scene faster than an ambulance, which greatly increases the chances of surviving.</li>
                 <li>&nbsp;<b>Mobile Infusion Stand</b> - a mobile infusion stand that may alleviate problems patients have when they are inconvenient to move (such as going to toilet).</li>

                <p>Before we start the project, we send an email to the doctor because we want to know their ideas and the achievability and limitations of the project. Unfortunately, we did not receive any response, so the hospital-related concepts were first excluded. However, before sending the email, I have drawn a storyboard about 'emergency supply drone'. The following diagram shows how this application is probably used.</p>

                <p>Ideally, each of us will draw a storyboard and interface for the concept we choose. However, because we only have two concepts, it can be confusing if each person draws a storyboard and an interface for each of the two concepts. Therefore, we decided to separate our work. Mira and Sina will each draw one conceptual storyboard and then two interface design (medical delivery and physical examination van). We believe this approach can make our design more reasonable and complete. Everyone has different ideas, so the final outcome of the interface will be different. Then I will choose the best part of everyone's design and eventually integrate it into a paper prototype using 'Pop'.</p>

                <p>After my team members completed their sketches, I first compared the differences between the two sketches and then analyzed which ones are more appropriate for the user. If I have some other thoughts, I will also draw my own ideas and discuss with the team members which idea are best. <br>
Partial adjustment of the medical drone interface:
</p>
				 <ul>
                 <li><b>Product interface</b>. In the original product interface, the team member only wrote the product name and price. I think users may also want to know more about the product information and its considerations. Meantime, in the original version, the user could not select the number of items. I think this is very inconvenient, so I suggest that they add '+' and '-' next to the button 'add'.
</li>
                </ul>
               <p>Partial adjustment of the physical examination van interface:</p>
                <ul>
                 <li><b>How to choose an appointment time</b>. In the beginning, their idea was to let users fill in their prefer time, but I think this is not convenient and intuitive for the user. Simultaneously, the time period filled out by the user may have been all reserved. Thus, I recommend using the form of timetable. The block of available time period is green, and the block of the reserved time period is red. I believe that in this way, the user can clearly understand which time periods have no additional empty physical examination van.
</li>
                 <li><b>ID upload</b>. At the beginning, the ID upload interface only has the word id upload, and there is no other explanation. I didn't quite understand the meaning of this page when I looked at it. The user who used it for the first time is definitely more confused. Therefore, I recommend adding the type of ID card that can be uploaded to the interface. This way the user can also know which ID card are approved and can be uploaded. At the same time, I suggest that they add 'front' and 'back' under the icon for uploading the ID card, because the user may not understand why there are two places to upload the ID card. Users must upload the front and back of the ID photo or their registration will fail. This is also to ensure that the user's information is accurate. This is also to ensure that the user's information is accurate. When using physical examination van later, we need the user to perform face verification. The camera on the van will be reviewed and compared according to the photo of the ID card and the real person. If users provide false information, they may face the dilemma of not being able to use van.
</li>
                </ul>

              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>We tested with about five users, and the research methods we used were: observation, think aloud, and interviews. Through these methods, we will have the opportunity to get a lot of feedback and messages from the user's speech and behavior. 
When testing the medical delivery interface, the common problems users have are:
</p>
			    <ul>
                 <li>Users will <font color="#CC9933"><b>expect and assume that everything is interactive</b></font>, so they will try to press all the buttons that can be pressed. When they press some buttons and the button doesn't give them a response, they will show a confused expression.</li>
                 <li>Users don't understand the meaning of some new features, so when they click on them, they may ask us what this feature does.</li>
                </ul>
               <p>The overall operating flow of the medical delivery interface is very similar to online shopping delivery, so users will not encounter any problems for most of the time. Meanwhile, users said they like the progress tracking system because they can see all the information, for example: the medicine is now in the packaging phase.</p>
               <p>When testing the physical examination van interface, the common problems users have are:</p>
                <ul>
                 <li>The user thinks that the icon for uploading the ID card is confusing. Some users <font color="#CC9933"><b>think the icon is unclickable</b></font>, while another user feels that it is not like an icon for uploading pictures.</li>
                 <li>In the booking interface, the user <font color="#CC9933"><b>does not quite understand the meaning and difference</b></font> between ‘basic check’ and ‘with diagnosis’. So, after that we might need to add a ‘?’ button to add annotations.</li>
                 <li>After the user has reserved the medical van, some users say they want to see the review. However, our original version didn't have this feature, so we'll add it later.</li>
                 <li>During the interview, some users indicated that the initial interface (login/registration) of the application was too sudden, and they hoped that we could add a welcome page. At the same time, the user believes that if the application can <font color="#CC9933"><b>suggest a parking spot</b></font>, it will be more friendly.</li>
                </ul>
               <p>Compared to the previous medical delivery, I can clearly see that users are experiencing many problems when using this application. Since it is a unique and novel concept, there are no similar applications on the market today. Therefore, users need to spend some time to understand and adapt. Moreover, they also need some assist from us to complete the task we give them (think aloud).</p>

              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>After improving the issues mentioned by the user, we plan to do a second iteration. After the modification, some of the users who participated in the previous test indicated that the new interface of medical delivery is more clear and well-labelled. They can <font color="#CC9933"><b>complete all orders on their own without any help from us</b></font>. In the new version, the problem users encounter is basically the same. They don't know or are not sure about the ‘regular order’ ordering process. They feel that this part needs some assist, otherwise it will be a bit troublesome. In addition, one user said that she would like to have a <font color="#CC9933"><b>second confirmation pop-up when making a payment</b></font>. This is because she is worried that she will accidentally click the confirmation button. If she pays directly, she will not be able to make any product changes.
</p>
				<p>When testing the physical examination van interface, most users said they knew and understood how to operate the application. Compared to the first interface, the second interface has clearly improved. The steps to book a medical van are very <b>streamlined and straightforward</b>, so they feel very time-saving and convenient. One of the most important findings is that the user wants the application to have a <font color="#CC9933"><b>recommendation list for the physical examination</b></font>. Some users say they may not understand what each item does, so they feel that it would be helpful to have a recommended list. At the same time, they also believe that each medical examination project needs to be annotated. They want to know what the physical examination item is, or what it means if the value is higher than xx number.</p>
                <p>After the second iteration, we asked each user which application they would prefer to see. All of their answers are physical examination van. First of all, they think this application is very <font color="#CC9933"><b>novel</b></font>, and there is no similar thing on the market. Second, it <font color="#CC9933"><b>can save a lot of time and money</b></font>, so they think this application is very useful and practical. After understanding the user's feelings and thoughts, we also analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of the two applications and made a design matrix. After the comparison, the physical examination van has obvious advantages, so we eventually decided to work on the physical examination van.</p>

                <p>The main body of the wireframe is done by Sina. Meanwhile, she is also responsible for putting the content into the software - inVision. After completing the above, we started our final user testing. In terms of product operation, most users did not encounter any problems. However, the <font color="#CC9933"><b>usage of some words is not very precise</b></font>, such as "note", which brings a little doubt. Therefore, some users will not understand the meaning. In this part we will do more research later.</p>
				<p>There is one user suggested sending a confirmation message to the user before the medical van goes to the destination. I discussed this with my team members and decided not to add this feature. Before the medical van arrives, there will be a banner prompt, and we think that is enough. At the same time, since the user has made an appointment, this indicates that they are free on that day. They should stay at their chosen address. If there is a sudden event, our app also supports cancel booking (at least one day in advance). Therefore, we feel that this feature is not very useful.</p>
