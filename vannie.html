                <p>Vannie is an app designed for users to interact with the proposed autonomous vehicle ‘physical examination van’. Based on research, the current health service is considered to be unapproachable and highly time-consuming. To reduce the time people spend on travelling or waiting in a medical center, Vannie is designed as one of the solution. Vannie is a physical examination van which comes to the user at the appointed position and time.</p>
                <p>There is an exisiting online video consultation service called ‘telehealth’ in Australia. Telehealth greatly saves the time spend on traveling and it is especially useful for people with chronic diseases. However, a common drawback of the online video consultation service is that they all lack accuracy as there is no physical examination. With Vannie aiding the diagnosis, people are able to get their diagnosis and physical examination done without going to a medical center or hospital.</p>
                <p>Moreover, Vannie is not only for people who’s sick, but also for people who want to know their physical condition better. Vannie is proposed to be used in a daily basis, facing people of all age. With the booking system, physical examination becomes highly accessible, no travelling time is required and no disruption to their daily routine.</p>

                    <li>&nbsp<b>Think aloud</b> is done by giving users task without instructing them how to use the app. Through this method we can quickly understand what problems they may encounter and user's thought.</li>
                    <li>&nbsp<b>Interviews</b> after the user tests the product will give us a deeper understanding of the customer's intuitive experience, and may get some useful feedback.</li>

                  As kids and the elderly would be considered unable to carried out the whole physical examination on their own due to the safety issue, they are excluded in the testing phase. There is no specific participant selection criteria as this service is proposed to be used by everyone.

                <p>We conducted 6 tests with different people. After three rounds of testing and modification from the previous assessment, most users can successfully complete the tasks without any assist. Problems encountered by users can basically be divided into two categories.</p>
                <p>Firstly, <b>wording</b>. User did not understand the usage of certain words, which made them confused when using the application. In this regard, we added annotations and made good use of different font colors. <p>
                <p>The second category was considered to be a constrain. As Vannie was still in its prototype stage, the prototype created with inVision <b>lacks a database and does not record the information entered</b>. Therefore, <b>not all content were interactive</b> at this stage. However, we found that with the styling, some listed information looked clickable as a button. Later, we modified the content that may be misleading to the users. In addition to the content that needed modification, users also gave us some other suggestions, such as: an estimate time before the physical examination van arrives and a rate page after the physical examination van is used. Referring to those recommendations, they are discussed and later to be tested on their feasibility and practicality.</p>
                <p>Users who have tested the app have expressed a lot of interest in our idea and design. They thought the concept was very innovative and definitely could improve their medical experience. The app offered a lot of options, it was very <b>user-friendly and customized</b>. Apart from this, the design of the interface was simple and clear. Every step is easy to understand. All the content inside was very consistent, which meant there was no confusion with what to do next.</p>

                <p>Through rounds of testing, we have incorporated our knowledge of <b>10 Usability Heuristics</b> for User Interface Design.
                  <ol>
                    <li>&nbsp<b>Visibility of system status</b>. For sign up and payment stage, we added in pop-up to notify users their action is completed/ successful. Meanwhile, we also have review page so users are clear with their choices.</li>
                    <li>&nbsp<b>User control and freedom</b>. Most pages has a go back button, they can always change what they’ve entered before.</li>
                    <li>&nbsp<b>Consistency and standards</b>. We worked on the color, placement of each button, having each title fixed to the header so every interface element was consistent through the whole process.</li>
                    <li>&nbsp<b>Error prevention</b>. This is presented in the set up of appointment time and position. With address, we offer suggestions instead of users manually type in, therefore, less typo. We have also constrained the types of input users can make with the time and date. </li>
                    <li>&nbsp<b>Flexibility and efficiency of use</b>. The whole process is linear and straight forward, therefore, no matter the user is experienced or not, they know what the next step is. </li>
                    <li>&nbsp<b>Help and documentation</b>. We have ‘my order’ set up so users can always review their past order and result.</li>

                <p>We have done a good job in styling the app with <b>aesthetic and minimalist design</b>. Our next step would be looking at the error message  helping users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors (e.g. entering the wrong medicare/reference number).</p>
                <p>At the same time, we believe that it is necessary to add a past examination result. It makes it easier for users to understand and record their health condition. In addition, we have also discussed that we don't need the profiles page at this stage. But for the future, this feature is indispensable because it can be used to store user information such as address, payment information, and more.</p>
