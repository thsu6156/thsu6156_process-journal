          <p>Vannie is an application designed to provide users with a <font color="#CC9933"><b>faster, more convenient and easy access to medical services</b></font>. <br>Based on the research, the existing health services are considered to be time-consuming and unapproachable. Vannie offers people a new solution, which is to <font color="#CC9933"><b>reduce the time they spend traveling or waiting in medical centers</b></font>.
            Vannie is a physical examination van that comes to the user at the appointed location and time. Users can save time for going to the hospital and have physical examinations near their homes. After the user has completed all the check components, the results will be sent to the user's mobile app (depending on the items, the testing time will vary).</p>

          <h3>Overview from Assessment 1</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>The significant finding that gleamed from the first report is that <font color="#CC9933"><b>most respondents avoid going to the doctor when they are sick</b></font> because the whole process is time-consuming. Moreover, it disrupts their normal life patterns. Especially for students, people with work or mobility difficulties, it is tedious and troublesome to spend time reserving and traveling to health service centers. We have discussed several times about how to solve the problem and come up with many different concepts, they are:</p>
          <ol>
           <li>&nbsp;Medical Delivery - customers are able to order the medicine online and drone will then ship the medicine to the designated location in a timely manner.</li>
           <li>&nbsp;Physical Examination Van - users can book a van for a medical examination instead of going to the hospital. This saves travel time and waiting time in the hospital.</li>
           <li>&nbsp;In-hospital Medication Delivery - a small automatic car that is mainly responsible for transporting drugs or injections. This may increase efficiency and save time for doctors/ nurses to take things.</li>
           <li>&nbsp;Emergency Supply Drone - a drone that transports medical equipment. It can reach the scene faster than an ambulance, which greatly increases the chances of surviving.</li>
           <li>&nbsp;Mobile Infusion Stand - a mobile infusion stand that may alleviate problems patients have when they are inconvenient to move (such as going to toilet).</li></ol>
          <p>Ideally, we should try all our ideas. However, the email we sent to the doctor did not receive a reply or some doctors rejected our interview. Thus, the hospital-related concepts (3-5) were first excluded. </p>

        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>Sketch is mainly drawn by team members, and I am responsible for sorting and screening sketch. When I find something unreasonable or needs improvement, I will discuss it with them and tell them what I think. Some improvements are:</p>
          <ul>
           <li><font color="#CC9933"><b>Time display for physical examination reservation</b></font>: Initially, their idea was to let users fill in their reservation time on their own. However, I think this is not intuitive and convenient for users. So I recommend that they change the time to a calendar-like format, showing only the time period for which an appointment is available. I think this will save more time for users. </li>
           <li><font color="#CC9933"><b>ID upload</b></font>: At the beginning, the ID upload interface only has the word ‘id upload’, and there is no other explanation. I think it lacks clear instructions. Therefore, I recommend adding the type of ID card that can be uploaded to the interface. This way the user can know which ID card are approved and can be uploaded. Meanwhile, I suggest that they add 'front' and 'back' under the icon for uploading the ID card, because the user may not understand why there are two places to upload the ID card. Users must upload the front and back of the ID photo or their registration will fail. This is also to ensure that the user's information is accurate. </li></ul>
          <p>The two images below show how I arranged the sketches and integrated them into the POP:</p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>We tested with about five users, and the research methods we used were: observation, think aloud, and interviews. Through these methods, we will have the opportunity to get a lot of feedback from the user's speech and behavior. Common problems for users when testing the medical delivery interface are:</p>
          <ul>
           <li>Users will <font color="#CC9933"><b>expect and assume that everything is interactive</b></font>. </li>
           <li>Users don't understand the meaning of some new features, e.g. regular order. </li>
           <li>Overall, the operate flow of the medical delivery interface is very <font color="#CC9933"><b>similar to online shopping delivery</b></font>, so most of the time the user can easily complete the whole process.</li>
         </ul>
          <p>When testing the physical examination van interface, the common problems users have are: </p>
          <ul>
           <li>Some users think the <font color="#CC9933"><b>icon for ‘uploading ID’ is unclickable</b></font>, while another user feels that it is not like an icon for uploading pictures.</li>
           <li>Users do not understand the meaning and difference between ‘basic check’ and ‘with diagnosis’. </li>
           <li>Some users mentioned that the initial interface (login/registration) of the application was too abrupt.</li>
           <li>The user believes that if the app can suggest a parking spot, it will be friendlier.</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Compared to the previous medical delivery, I can clearly see that users are experiencing many problems when using this application. Since it is a unique and novel concept, users need to spend some time to understand and adapt. Moreover, they also need some assistance from us to complete the task we give them (think aloud).</p>
         <p>After improving the issues mentioned by the user, we conducted a second iteration. </p>
         <ul>
          <li>Some of the users who participated in the previous test said that the new interface of medical delivery is <font color="#CC9933"><b>more clear and well-labeled</b></font>. They can complete all orders on their own without any help from us. But one user mentioned that she would like to have a second confirmation pop-up when making a payment.</li>
          <li>When testing the physical examination van interface, most users said they knew and understood how to operate the application. Compared to the first interface, the second interface has clearly improved. The steps to book a medical van are very streamlined and straightforward, they feel very <font color="#CC9933"><b>time-saving and convenient</b></font>. One of the most important findings is that the user wants the application to have a <font color="#CC9933"><b>recommendation list</b></font> for the physical examination. Some users say they may not understand what each item does, so they feel that it would be helpful to have a recommended list.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After the second iteration, we asked each user which application they would prefer to see. All their answers are physical examination van. Ultimately, we chose physical examination van because it had more advantages, such as more innovation and time saving, and many users said they were more willing to see and use such products.</p>

          <p>Our interface consists mainly of colour green and white because we want to bring a <font color="#CC9933"><b>clean and professional feel</b></font>. Green is a comfortable color and can relieves certain stress. Meanwhile, green also represents vitality.
            <br><br>For the user, when they feel uncomfortable, what they want most is to be able to complete the operation easily and quickly. They don't want to be spend a long time doing something when they are not feeling well. Time is precious to them, so we have to simplified many processes.
We reduce the use of images or icons, and the flow of our application is straightforward because we believe that users can operate applications without problems is our primary goal.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Here are the major improvements:</p>
          <ol>
           <li><b> Sign up page</b>.&nbsp;It is essential to confirm user's identity due to the personal privacy and the reliability of the results. Meanwhile, we added annotated so that users can know what type of Id can be uploaded.</li>
           <li><b> Make appointment</b>.&nbsp;It includes all the details (checking components, address, date) users need to input in one page. Users are able to review and change the detail in any time. </li>
           <li><b>	My order</b>.&nbsp;It allows users to easily view and find all the content they need. In the event of an emergency, the user can also cancel the reservation in advance.</li>
